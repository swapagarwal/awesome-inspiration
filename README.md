## Movies

- The Pursuit of Happyness [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454921/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pursuit_of_Happyness)
  - [Basketball Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPEdwaLQLag) Don't ever let somebody tell you... You can't do something. Not even me. All right? You got a dream... You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it. Period.
  - [Ending Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8-7mHT9edg) This part of my life... this part right here? This is called "happyness."
- Facing the Giants [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805526/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facing_the_Giants)
  - [The Death Crawl Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sUKoKQlEC4) The scene where the football coach gets the most influential player on the team to do a blind-fold crawl, so that he would not know how far he could go, while carrying a teammate on his back. The coach pushes him with extreme motivation and tells him to never quit. Even when the player yells it hurts, the coach yells "let it!". The player finally drops and he has made it all the way to the end zone, where the coach tells him how important it is for an influential individual to lead by example.
- Rocky Balboa [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479143/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Balboa_(film))
  - [Inspirational Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Vg4uyYwEk) Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! Now if you know what you're worth then go out and get what you're worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!

## Quotes

- Michael Jordan
  - I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. <br> ![](https://callingdreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Michael-Jordan-Quote-1.jpg)
- Will Smith
  - The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I'm not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things you got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple, right? <br> ![](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/pppt-willsmith-140925035833-phpapp01/95/will-smith-quotes-9-638.jpg?cb=1411617693)
- Steven Furtick
  - The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone else's highlight reel. <br> ![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/45/c3/4645c3caec17c4bdb22a4bad231fd16d.jpg)
- Dr. Seuss
  - Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple. <br> ![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/58/84/3b588488542af2b56d7d7ab5c54d8eb0.jpg)
