## Movies

- The Pursuit of Happyness [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454921/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pursuit_of_Happyness)
  - [Basketball Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPEdwaLQLag) Don't ever let somebody tell you... You can't do something. Not even me. All right? You got a dream... You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it. Period.
  - [Ending Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8-7mHT9edg) This part of my life... this part right here? This is called "happyness."

## Quotes

- Michael Jordan
  - I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.
- Will Smith
  - The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I'm not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things you got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple, right?
